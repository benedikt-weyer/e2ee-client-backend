# e2ee-client-backend

Browser-first TypeScript client backend for end-to-end encrypted frontend data access.

## What is implemented

- Adapter interfaces for GraphQL and REST backends.
- A LokiJS-backed in-memory cache for decrypted entities.
- A generic encrypted-field repository layer that behaves like a small frontend ORM.
- AES-256-GCM encryption compatible with the current dashboard flow.
- A WASM-backed post-quantum envelope strategy using ML-KEM-768 plus AES-256-GCM.
- Entity schemas for dashboard blobs and partial-field integration records.
- Legacy blob compatibility helpers so existing dashboard ciphertext plus nonce pairs can still be used.
- Unit tests for strategies, repositories, and transports.

## Package layout

- `src/adapters` contains transport and CRUD adapter abstractions.
- `src/cache` contains the LokiJS cache store.
- `src/compat` contains helpers for the dashboard's current ciphertext plus nonce format.
- `src/crypto` contains key derivation and encryption strategies.
- `src/repositories` contains the generic encrypted entity repository.
- `src/schemas` contains reusable entity mappings.

## Dashboard integration

The dashboard web app consumes this package through a local file dependency. The current integration already uses the package for:

- password-derived key material
- dashboard config encryption and decryption
- Plandera config encryption and decryption
- REST transport creation for Plandera API calls
- repository bridge factories in `apps/web/src/lib/client-backend.ts`

The dashboard backend still stores integrations as one encrypted blob today. The package already supports partial-field encryption, but the backend migration for true partial-field storage still needs to be completed in a later iteration.
